Educational Game using Python
------------------------------
I recently visited a local school and delivered a presentation on python games. 
The school were pleased with the outcome of the visit and have asked my company to create a program to engage, and develop maths skills for younger children junior programmer for an educational charity which supports young children in developing Maths skills. 

Description
-------------
The programme should run a game where the user has to answer a series of simple random arithmetic questions (add, subtract, multiply and divide) using whole numbers between 1 and 12. Subtraction and division should not produce negative answers. Each game should have 10 questions and the programme should keep track of the score. 
Three levels should be provided,
	level 0 has no time limit, 
	level 1 has a 20 second time limit per question
	level 2 has a 10 second time limit per question. 
The user should be able to log in securely. The programme should record and store the user’s names and scores. 
This will produce a league table to introduce competitiveness within the users to be top of the league. 
I have been asked to design and develop a computer program to manage the scoring system for the app.
